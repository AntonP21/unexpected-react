# Changelog

## v0.2.x

Original version from [podio](https://github.com/podio)

## v0.3.0

* Initial version using [unexpected-htmllike](https://github.com/bruderstein/unexpected-htmllike) and 
[react-render-hook](https://github.com/bruderstein/react-render-hook) to provide assertions on the 
full virtual DOM

## v0.3.1

* Fix dependencies - issue seen when using npm 2.x (thanks to @faceyspacey for reporting)

## v0.3.2

* Fix error handling when react-render-hook was not injected

## v0.4.0

* Update to v0.4.1 of unexpected-htmllike-jsx-adapter, to add support for iterators as children
Thanks to @jkimbo for the failing test, and @Lugribossk for reporting

## v0.4.1

* Force dependency update to unexpected-htmllike 0.3.2 - important bugfix for 'to contain', when a child element 
is not identical, but actually matches with the `to contain` flags that are in place.

## v0.5.0

* Update to unexpected-htmllike 0.4.0, and add className diffing, using class semantics. i.e. order does not matter,
extra classes are ignored by default (not with `exactly` style assertions).

## v0.5.1

* Patch version of unexpected-htmllike-jsx-adapter to support flattening children (only a package.json update)

## v0.5.2

* Patch version of unexpected-htmllike to ^0.5.0 to fix issue with reordered children

## v1.0.0

* Update to unexpected-htmllike v1.0.0 - much faster due to attempting everything sync first, before reverting  
to async if an async assertion is encountered.  You no longer need to return the result of the `expect`, unless 
you're actually doing an asynchronous `expect.it()` assertion somewhere in your `expected` value. 

## v1.0.1

* Patch version of unexpected-htmllike to ^1.1.0 (improves output for function props, and props with undefined values - #15)

## v2.0.0

* Props / Attributes are now tested with `to satisfy` semantics, unless `exactly` is specified, in which case
`to equal` is used.  This is probably what was expected, but could mean some tests that previously failed now pass,
hence the major version.

* `queried for` support for both shallow and deep renderers
* `with event` event triggering for shallow and deep renderers

## v2.0.1

* Fix rendering numerical 0, via a fix from react-devtools

## v3.0.0

* Drop support for React 0.13.x and add support for React v15 (thanks Gustav Nikolaj #19)
* Remove need for Symbol polyfill (fixed #18)

## v3.0.1

* Remove unexpected-documentation-site-generator from the dependencies (thanks @jkimbo #20)

## v3.0.2

* Update various dependencies, so that React 0.13 is properly no longer supported, and
React v15 *is* properly supported, without peerDep warnings (thanks @choffmeister)

## v3.1.0

* Enable using `queried for` and `with event` as the resolution of the promise.

## v3.1.1

* Update to htmllike 2.0.2, fixes output issue

## v3.1.2

* Fix for combining `queried for` and `with event` in the deep renderer (#23 - thanks @janmeier for reporting)

## v3.1.3

* Fix for 'not to contain' and 'to contain with all children' after event
